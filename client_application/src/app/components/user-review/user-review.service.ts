      "review":`We stayed at The Lalit Golf Resort and Spa, Goa. We had planned to stay cosily at one spot and not travel much. At The Resort, we found all that we were hoping for and more! The property is huge! And lush green. The pool is nice and
      The sunken bar adds to The pool experience. They also a private Beach which is nestled between two hill ranges and two rivers. The kids activity area is small but nice. Spa is great. And to top it all, The food is great. We ate
      at The Oko. We had our 2 1/2 yr old daughter with us and The staff was very helpful with The food for The baby. To mention few names- Sagar, Ronit and Meghna were like Rockstars. They helped us a lot with any and all The demands
      we made. This one will surely be memorable.`,
